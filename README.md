# Algorithm_Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is a web application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It allows users to interactively observe how different sorting algorithms operate on a given set of data.

# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The core web technologies are used to build the user interface and implement the sorting algorithm visualizations.
DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is manipulated to dynamically update the user interface elements and visualize the sorting process.
Asynchronous Programming: Asynchronous functions and promises are used to handle time delays and ensure smooth execution of the sorting algorithm visualizations.

# Getting Started
1. To run the Sorting Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

2. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:
cd sorting-visualizer

4. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

5. Interact with the application by selecting a sorting algorithm, adjusting the speed and size settings, and observing the visualizations.
